## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains the complete case study analysis for the QYF Virtual Internship Assessment 2026. The project explores critical banking concepts including operational risk, credit risk, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors in the context of the G20 Summit 2025 commitments.

The project examines how banks must embed resilience and responsibility into their strategies, addressing:
- **Operational Risk**: Employee attrition and its impact on banking stability
- **Credit Risk**: Risk-based pricing models and sustainable lending practices
- **ESG Integration**: Alignment with climate goals and ethical governance

## 🎯 Project Context

Following the G20 Summit 2025 in Johannesburg, global leaders committed to:
- Multilateral cooperation
- Climate action
- Debt sustainability

This project demonstrates how banks must operationalize these principles through robust risk management frameworks that not only avoid losses but build sustainable banking systems supporting global priorities.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Operational Risk
Risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or external events. Includes employee errors, fraud, natural disasters, and climate change impacts.

### Credit Risk Metrics
- **PD**: Likelihood of loan default (3+ consecutive missed payments)
- **EAD**: Total exposure at time of default
- **LGD**: Percentage of EAD expected to be lost after recoveries

### Risk-Based Pricing
Strategy where interest rates and terms are determined by borrower creditworthiness. Higher perceived risk = higher rates/fees.

### RAROC Methodology
Financial framework assessing profitability while considering associated risks. Decision criterion: RAROC > Hurdle Rate (typically 15%+ for banks).

### ESG Pillars
- **Environmental**: Carbon reduction, waste management, climate mitigation
- **Social**: Working conditions, diversity, community engagement
- **Governance**: Leadership structure, controls, compliance, ethics

### Task 5: RAROC Calculation

Calculate the Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital for each company's ESG initiatives.

#### Step 1: Calculate Risk-Adjusted Headline Earnings

**Formula**:
```
Risk-Adjusted Headline Earnings = Operating Income - Total Expenses - Expected Losses
```

**For Green Horizon Bank**:
```
Operating Income = ?
Total Expenses = R8 million (given)
Expected Losses = 0 (already accounted for)

RAHE = Operating Income - R8,000,000 - 0
```

**For Blue Earth Finance**:
```
Operating Income = R8.4 billion (given, losses accounted for)
Total Expenses = R7.9 billion (given)
Expected Losses = 0 (already accounted for)

RAHE = R8,400,000,000 - R7,900,000,000 = R500,000,000
```

#### Step 2: Calculate RAROC

**Formula**:
```
RAROC = Risk-Adjusted Headline Earnings / Total Allocated Capital
```

**For Green Horizon Bank**:
```
RAROC = R800,000,000 / R1,050,000,000 = 76.19%
```

**For Blue Earth Finance**:
```
RAROC = R500,000,000 / R850,000,000 = 58.82%
```

#### Step 3: Interpret Results

**Benchmark**: RAROC above 15% is considered good for banks.

**Analysis Questions**:
1. Which company has higher RAROC?
2. Are both above the 15% threshold?
3. What explains the difference in RAROC?
4. What does this mean for ESG investment decisions?

#### What Drives High or Low RAROC?

**High RAROC Indicators**:
- Strong revenue generation
- Efficient cost management
- Lower expected losses
- Optimal capital allocation
- High-quality risk management
- Strategic ESG investments with returns

**Low RAROC Indicators**:
- Weak revenue streams
- High operating costs
- Elevated expected losses
- Excessive capital allocation
- Poor risk management
- ESG investments without financial return

**Company-Specific Analysis**:

For **Green Horizon Bank**:
- Why is RAROC 76.19%?
- What are the key drivers?
- Is this sustainable?

For **Blue Earth Finance**:
- Why is RAROC 58.82%?
- What are the constraints?

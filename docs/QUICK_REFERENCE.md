## 📐 Key Formulas

### Operational Risk
```
Attrition Rate = (Employees Left / Average Employees) × 100%
```

### Credit Risk - Loan Payment
```
M = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
M = Monthly payment
P = Principal
r = Monthly rate (annual/12)
n = Number of months
```

### Credit Risk - Interest & Principal
```
Interest = Opening Balance × (Annual Rate / 12)
Principal Payment = Monthly Payment - Interest
Closing Balance = Opening Balance - Principal Payment
```

### Credit Risk - RAROC
```
NII = Opening Balance × (Rate - CoF) / 12
Operating Income = NII + NIR
RAHE = Operating Income - Expenses - Expected Loss
RAROC = RAHE / Total ECAP × 100%
```

### Credit Risk - Economic Profit
```
EP = RAHE - (Total ECAP × Hurdle Rate)
```

### ESG - RAROC
```
RAHE = Operating Income - Total Expenses - Expected Loss
RAROC = RAHE / Allocated Capital × 100%
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Operational Risk (Basel)
Risk of loss from failed internal processes, people, systems, or external events.

### Credit Risk
Risk that borrower fails to meet loan obligations.

### RAROC
Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital - measures profitability relative to risk.

**Benchmark**: >15% is good for banks

### Hurdle Rate
Minimum acceptable return; typical: 15% for banks.

### ESG
Environmental, Social, Governance - framework for sustainability assessment.

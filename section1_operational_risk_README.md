## 🔍 Key Concepts & Definitions

### Attrition Rate
```
Attrition Rate = (Number of Employees Who Left / Average Number of Employees) × 100
```

### Types of Attrition
- **Voluntary**: Employee chooses to leave
- **Involuntary**: Termination by employer
- **Retirement**: Planned exit
- **Functional**: Low performers leave
- **Dysfunctional**: High performers leave (most concerning)

### Operational Risk Capital
Banks must allocate capital to cover potential operational risk losses using Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) under Basel framework.
